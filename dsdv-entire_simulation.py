Working of the DSDV Protocol:

The Destination Sequenced Distance Vector(DSDV) routing protocol is an ad-hoc protocol used for for infrastructureless MANET routing. It has the following characteristics which we shall address in the following points:

1. It is a proactive routing protocol.
2. It is based on the distance vector routing algorithm which used Bellman Ford Algorithm.

We shall now explain its working along with the explanation of the corresponding code segments.
Firstly, we define the classes for Node, Packet and a NetworkSimulator. In DSDV, each node consists of a forwarding table and an advertised table. We have also assumed the node to have one interface for now whose IP address is stored as the Node class variable. 
In the Packet class, we have attributed each packet with its source IP, destination IP, packet sequence number and a timestamp variable to hold the start_time value which will come into picture while calculating latency.

After initialization of a random/ predefined graph with a predefined number of nodes and edges, the forwarding table of each node object of the Node class is prepared by entering the directly connected node entries, with metric as 0, next hop as the node IP itself, and the sequence number also as 0. 
Following this, certain specified number of full dump advertisements are simulated throughout the graph so that the neighboring nodes can gather the information including next hop and metrics corresponding to all the destinations abiding by the distance vector algorithm. Here full dump refers to advertizing the entire routing table to the neighbors in contrast to an incremental dump where only the changed/ updated routes are advertized. 
This characteristic of DSDV to ensure that a fully filled forwarding table to exist for each node makes it a proactive protocol.

A predefined source and destination node is specified followed by a variable which holds the value for number of changes we wish to simulate in the graph.
We then call the run_network_changes(). Now, a Packet is created and the corresponding member variable initialization is done. The next hop IP is checked in the forwarding table of the current node and the packet is sent to that next IP. In this transition, the packet sequence number is also incremented.
Once the packet reaches the destination, we simulate the most important characteristic- dynamic topology change, when it comes to MANET protocols. A random function checks if the probability for the disconnection of a node falls within the range of a predefined value. If yes, a random node is disconnected from the graph. The disconnect_node() function is called which uses a breadth-first search like approach to broadcast and advertize the changed metric which is now set to infinity for all the nodes which have the next hop equal to the now disconnected node. This is done via an incremental dump. Say one node A intially had to go through B on its way to C. Now if B is disconnected, besides setting B's metric as infinity in its forwarding table, A will also set C's metric as infinity since it is currently not reachable. The sequence number is also appropriately incremented. 

After this first round of advertisement, the advertise_method() is called again. Here the nodes which were not disconnected but at the same time not reachable by some nodes become reachable, since the nodes learn about new routes and update their forwarding table accordingly. 

Now, similar to the disconnection probability, we have set a reconnection probability, where if the value lies within a predefined range, the node will be reconnected to a randomly generated new set of neighbors. The forwarding and the advertized tables will be updated accordingly. 

Types of Messages in DSDV:
1. Full dump update: The entire forwarding table is advertized to neighboring nodes (though its periodicity is less)
2. Incremental update: Only the routes which have changed and their sequence number have been incremented are advertized to the neighboring nodes.

Data Structures used
1. Graph: Implemented using Python dictionaries to represent:
	a. The network topology including the nodes and edges between any two nodes.
	b. The forwarding and advertized tables for each node.
2. Lists: Implemented using Python lists to store mutable values corresponding to different variables such as storage of neighboring nodes, or visited nodes in case of BFS.
3. Queue: Implemented using Python lists to perform FIFO approach while sending a triggered incremental dump update corresponding to the disconnection of a node in the BFS method and disconnect_node method()
